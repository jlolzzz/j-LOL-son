### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer of sorts. I have done web development, a little application development, and some focused systems engineering development. 
Curently I have a couple private projects I am working on. But nothing ready to be taken public yet. 
I still look for open source projects to contribute to when I get some free time. 

I've started blogging as well octotype.app/j-LOL-son
